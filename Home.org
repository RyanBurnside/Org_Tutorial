* Org Spreadsheet/Table** Creeation
** Creation  
   For a simple starter table, just enter |- and press tab over it.
   This will give you a 5 column 1 header, 1 row table.
   Use TAB to move from cell to tell or SHIFT TAB to move backward
   Pressing ENTER on a cell inserts a new row
   Pressing M-Shift and UP deletes the current row
   Pressing M-Shift and LEFT deletes the current column
   There are more commands, notice that you have a "Tbl" button on your file menu while in org mode.
   If you don't have the menu enabled, just press F10.
   

** Elisp and Calc calculations
   You can do calculations in one of two languages. There is a Calc mode (a bit like Excel) or an Emacs Lisp mode.
   You can reference individual cells, individual columns, ranges, and relative cells and columns. (You have homework, research this)
   The columns start at 1 ($1)
   Place a :: mark between formulas *NOTE* They ALL need to be on 1 line. I'm sorry it's gross. You can have more than one but you'll have to eval them each manually.

Below, I tell the spreadsheet column 1 is simply 13.
I then tell the spreadsheet that column 2 is random, I use Elisp here which MUST be quoted for the spreadsheet.
Column 3 uses the special Calc syntax. (I don't believe you can mix Elisp and Calc syntax in the same calculation)

(Press C-c C-c on the formula line at the bottom to evaluate the formula and polulate the columns)
| Value A | Value B | Sum |
|---------+---------+-----|
|         |         |     |
|         |         |     |
|         |         |     |
|         |         |     |
|         |         |     |
|         |         |     |
|         |         |     |
#+TBLFM: $1=13::$2='(random 100)::$3=$1+$2


** Making URLS with parameters


** Sorting
Hmm let's take the table from our previous section.
Evalulate it with C-c C-c on the formula line.
Then let's sort. We are going to sort on sum.
Move your cursor to the body of the sum colum (anywhere) and press C-c ^ (sometimes it is fussy, if that happens just do M-x org-sort)

| Value A | Value B | Sum |
|---------+---------+-----|
|      13 |      56 |  69 |
|      13 |      78 |  91 |
|      13 |      47 |  60 |
|      13 |       8 |  21 |
|      13 |      48 |  61 |
|      13 |      26 |  39 |
|      13 |      14 |  27 |
#+TBLFM: $1=13::$2='(random 100)::$3=$1+$2

* Encryptions usg pgp
  Use M-x epa-encrypt-region and M-x epa-decrypt-region to deal with encrypting text.
  First highlight the entire region including the header and footer message
  (Try decrypting the block below with 'password' as your password)
  *NOTE* You will need the commandline version of pgp installed on your system.
