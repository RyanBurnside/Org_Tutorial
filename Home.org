* Todo Lists
  Todo lists must be headings and cycle with C-c C-t
  My Todo List (press C-c C-t to toggle state on each line)
** TODO Clean Floors
** TODO Pickup Office
** TODO Rake Leaves
** TODO Coffee with /Knights of Lambda Calculus/
** TODO Illuminati Bakeoff


* Checkboxes
  Checkboxes are quite interesting too, they're a bit like TODO press C-c C-c to toggle them
  They need a - mark followed by a box
  - [ ] Toggle this checkbox with C-c C-c

  Interestingly enough, they can also be used to calculate percent done or items done
  To calculate percent use a [0%] Parent checkbox or a [0/1] parent checkbox
  Indent child boxes to show ownership

  - [0%]
    - [ ] don't cycle this one
    - [ ] do cycle this one
    - [ ] One more here this should give us 66% above

  Now we'll do a counting hierarchy
  - [0/4]
    - [ ] Bread
    - [ ] Milk
    - [ ] Cheese
    - [ ] Lizard eggs

  You can use [/] after a TODO section and [-] boxes on major topics to sum the whole project

** TODO Night Eagle Defence Project [0/2]
   - [-] Funding
     - [ ] Ask Scientologists
     - [X] Ask Lizardmen
     - [X] Ask DARPA
   - [-] Planning
     - [X] Donna in HR (staffing)
     - [ ] Tom in Finance (swindling)
     - [X] Hans in European Relations (European Relations)

* Linking (Local files and URL)
  *note* I highly suggest using relative linking paths and keeping everything
  in a hiarchy of folders so you can zip 'n ship your .org notes folders.

  You can do URL links like [[http://www.google.com][this]].
  Link to other org files like [[./Notes/random-note-page.org][this]].
  Link to images like (Toggle visibility with: C-c C-x C-v or org-toggle-inline-images)
  #+CAPTION: Flow of the Lisp REPL
  #+NAME:   fig:REPL-IMAGE
  [[./Images/REPL.png]]

  #+CAPTION: The Emacs Logo
  #+NAME:   fig:EMACS-IMAGE
  [[./Images/Emacs.svg]]

    (print "Hello World!")
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
